\cvsection{Summary}
I am a 4th-year Doctoral student at NSRL\@USTC on the distributed
control system for large scientific facilities, especially the particle
accelerator. My Ph.D research work covers a range of issues: Large
distributed control system, Data acquisition, storage, retrieval,
visualization and mining, Interlocking and alarm for the control system,
System redundancy and availability, Industrial real-time Ethernet.\
I am looking for a postdoctoral or engineer's position in the particle
accelerator laboratory.
